# Neural Network from Scratch

This project is a personal challenge to build a simple neural network from scratch using only Python and NumPy.

## Objective

The goal is to create a neural network capable of learning to approximate the sine function (`y = sin(x)`).

## Architecture

The network is composed of:
- **Neurons**: The basic computational unit, with weights, a bias, and an activation function.
- **Layers**: A collection of neurons that process inputs and produce a set of outputs.
- **Network**: A sequence of layers (input, hidden, output) that perform a full forward pass.

## How to Run

To see the current state of the network and run a single forward pass, ensure you have Python and NumPy installed and run the main script from your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
